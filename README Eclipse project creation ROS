Execute following command on top level directory

catkin_make --force-cmake -G"Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles"

Next run the following command to pass the current shell environment into the make process in Eclipse.

awk -f $(rospack find mk)/eclipse.awk build/.project > build/.project_with_env && mv build/.project_with_env build/.project

For adding debugging execute the following line

cmake ../src -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug


Import the project into Eclipse by selecting "import existing project" 
and navigate to the "build" folder.


After importing, right click on the project and click properties -> C/C++ general -> Preprocessor Include Paths, Macros etc. Click the tab "Providers" and check the box next to "CDT GCC Built-in Compiler Settings [ Shared ]".

Afterwards, right click the project, select Index -> Rebuild. This will rebuild your index. Once this is done, usually all includes will resolve. 




###TODO

-add building process with CMakelists reminder
-add running inside of eclipse for debugging
